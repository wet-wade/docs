        <h3>UI Motivation</h3>
        <p>
          This application is mainly focused on mobile devices, therefore we need a simple layout, that the user can
          easily interact with in a tactile manner.
        </p>
        <p>
          The screens hierarchy has been structured with the focus on the group entity, as that's where the user will
          spend most of its time. The following figure illustrates the screens hierarchy.
        </p>
        <figure typeof="sa:image">
          <a href="diagrams/ui-routing.jpg" target="_blank">
            <img src="diagrams/ui-routing.jpg" alt="user interface routing" />
          </a>
        </figure>
        <p>
          In the next sections we will discuss each screen with respect to its functionality, layout and UI/UX
          considerations.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="splash-screen">
        <h3>Splash Screen</h3>
        <p>
          Although the splash screen is not really visible, it is present, and it's purpuse it's to decide the further
          direction that the user should take in our application.
        </p>
        <p>
          It primarily tries to redirect to the user groups screen, and if that fails due to the user not being
          authenticated, it will redirect the user to the authentication module.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="group-join-screen">
        <h3>Group Joining Screen</h3>
        <p>
          In the context of WET application, users can adhere to other groups by accessing a special joining address,
          that needs to be shared by the creator of the group.
        </p>
        <p>
          This screen has no other purpose than presenting the user with the group that he's about to join, and checking
          if they're logged in or not, in which case an input asking for the user's name will be shown, so the user can
          join the group as a temporary member.
        </p>
        <figure typeof="sa:image">
          <a href="assets/screenshots/join-group.jpg" target="_blank">
            <img src="assets/screenshots/join-group.jpg" alt="join group" />
          </a>
        </figure>
        <p>
          After confirming the group join, the user will be (authenticated if they're a temporary group member and)
          redirected to the main screen of the application, which is the group list, that we will discuss later.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="login-screen">
        <h3>Login Screen</h3>
        <p>
          In the case that the user is not authenticated, and he is not accessing a group join link, the login screen is
          the first interaction with the application
        </p>
        <p>
          The purpose of this screen is clear, we need to authenticate already registered users via username and
          password.
        </p>
        <figure typeof="sa:image">
          <a href="assets/screenshots/login-screen.jpg" target="_blank">
            <img src="assets/screenshots/login-screen.jpg" alt="login" />
          </a>
        </figure>
        <p>
          The user is presented with a minimal form, with 2 fields: <strong>username</strong> and
          <strong>password</strong>. There is also a button to redirect to the registration screen, in case the user is
          not already registered.
        </p>
        <p>
          These fields have a validation that ensures the fields are not empty, and disables the submit button
          otherwise.
        </p>
        <figure typeof="sa:image">
          <a href="assets/screenshots/login-validation.jpg" target="_blank">
            <img src="assets/screenshots/login-validation.jpg" alt="login" />
          </a>
        </figure>
      </section>
      <section id="register-screen">
        <h3>Register Screen</h3>
        <p>
          The registration screen is very similar with the login screen, both in user experience and purpose. If the
          user has no registered account, they can chose to create an account, via the registration form.
        </p>
        <figure typeof="sa:image">
          <a href="assets/screenshots/registration-screen.jpg" target="_blank">
            <img src="assets/screenshots/registration-screen.jpg" alt="login" />
          </a>
        </figure>
        <p>
          This screen has a link back to the login screen, in case the user got here by mistake, and they already have
          an account.
        </p>
        <p>
          Both the registration and the login screen will redirect the user to the main screen after the authentication
          is successful.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="main-screen">
        <h3>Main Screen (Groups list screen)</h3>
        <p>
          The main screen of the application presents the user with all the groups that they are a member of. The groups
          are presented in a mobile-friendly manner, using <strong>cards</strong>>, and large control buttons.
        </p>
        <figure typeof="sa:image">
          <a href="assets/screenshots/groups-list.jpg" target="_blank">
            <img src="assets/screenshots/groups-list.jpg" alt="login" />
          </a>
        </figure>
        <p>Each group card may have two options: group settings, and group devices.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Group settings</strong> button will redirect the user to the group settings, which we will discuss
            later. This option is available only for the creator of the group.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Group devices</strong> button will redirect the user to the devices screen, which we will also
            discuss later. This option is available for each member of the group.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          It is worth noting that there is a button that allows the user to create a new group. This button will show a
          modal that requires the user to input the group name, and will create a new group with that name. This option
          is available just for the registered accounts, so temporary group members will not be able to create groups
        </p>
