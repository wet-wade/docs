      <h2>Abstract</h2>
      <p>
        WET - Web of Things Platform is a Web tool that allows individuals to create groups of devices, interact with them,
        manage permissions to other users or visitors, which are represented by temporary users which are invited to join a 
        group.
      </p>
      <p>
        We wish to develop a platform that allows ease of use, friendly & responsive UI and easy management and iteraction
        smart devices.

      <h2>Architecture</h2>

      <p>
        The architecture of our platform is split into two main components: a front-end which is represented by a client
        built over Angular 11 with Material Design including components of Angular Material and a back-end represented by
        two smaller components, one being the Python Flask API.

        <h3>Back end</h3>
        <p>
          At the core of our data modeling we identify 4 core entities: Users, Devices, Permissions and Groups
        </p>
        <p>
          Users are represented by the people that will interract with our application, holding key information regarding 
          identifiers: id, email, name, password and mobile phone.
        </p>
        <p>
          We used Groups as a way to represent the similarity of User's access rights. Groups can consist of one or more 
          Users and hold the permissions that will take effect upon different actions on our devices.
        </p>
        <p>
          Devices are nothing but simple electonics that have the ability to connect to the local network and communicate 
          with our application. Devices can be discovered and attached to a certain group.
        </p>
        <p>
          In order to represent the permissons that take place between users and devices we modeled the Permissions entity 
          that holds information related to basic READ, WRITE and MANAGE roles as well as the device we have created this 
          permissions. Groups hold these permissions we created, and can be more than 1.
        </p>
  
        <figure typeof="sa:image">

            <img src="diagrams/backend-arhitecture.jpg" alt="backend arhitecture" />
          </a>
        </figure>
  
        <p>
          In order to manage the described entities, we created controllers for each module: devices, authentication and groups. 
          Using these controllers we obtained full access in creating a suitable REST API to fulfill our needs.
        </p>
  
        <figure typeof="sa:image">
          <a href="assets/screenshots/endpoints.jpg" target="_blank">
            <img src="assets/screenshots/endpoints.jpg" alt="classes" />
          </a>
        </figure>
  
        <p>
          Managing the devices is done in multiple ways: discovering the available devices on a network, which are saved at group 
          level under 'was discovered', point at which we first assign an id to them.
          We also have the possibility to dispaly the paired devices to a group, or even send commands to a certain device.
        </p>
        <p>
          Group controllers took up more functionality than the other two controllers, having multiple jobs assigned: adding permissions 
          and members to a group, creating a new group, retriving the groups associated with the current authenticated user, getting a 
          short summary or full data about a group.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the authentication component, we have implemented the login functionality (done with username and password). This will 
          restrict unauthorized users from accesing sensitive data and prevents unwanted actions taking place. In case of login, we are 
          making use of a token to authenticate further actions on the application, without the need of constantly entering credentials. 
          For the last part we also implemented a mechanism for registering, during which the Users entity will be populated with information 
          like a encrypted password and username.
        </p>

      <section id="arch-sparql">
        <h3>SPARQL</h3>
        <p>
          Interaction with SPARQL was made using Fuseki WebApp, and it helped visualising the query results and how to map them against the model, 
          and with SPARQL Wrapper in Python.
        </p>
        <p>
          The following query is used during the construction of the <code>GET /groups/:group_id</code> request. The way we designed the group is 
          that we initially create the group itself, then allow the user to add devices and/or set permissions for them. This being said, initially
          we would not have any values that populate the <code>consistsOf</code> and <code>hasPermission</code> relations and teh query would fail.
          Given this, without the OPTIONAL operator the query will fail on the initial state of the group.
        </p>
        <p>
          <code>

                   <br/>OPTIONAL {

                   <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;         ?permissions permissions:deviceId ?permission_device_id .
                   <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;         ?permissions permissions:memberId ?permission_member_id .
                   <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;         ?permissions permissions:manage ?permission_can_manage .
                   <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;         ?permissions permissions:read ?permission_can_read .
                   <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;         ?permissions permissions:write ?permission_can_write .
                   <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;   }
              <br/>}
          </code>
        </p>

        <p>
          Another interesting query, or command to be more exact, is the one for updating permissions. Due to the nature of the 
          SPARQL, there are no <code>UPDATE</code> statements per se, but combined <code>DELETE - INSERT</code> statements, this 
          is due to the necessity of deleting the nodes and recreating them. Here we used the FILTER operator to select only the
          permission referring to that member and device.
        </p>
        <p>
          <code>
            <br/>DELETE {{

        <h3>Back-End Motivation</h3>
        <p>
          We prefered using Python due to it's increased flexibility regarding types, allowing us to focus on the relations
          we built din the database and how to extract, parse and expose them to the client. Combining the following components, 
          where where able to create a streamlined flow from the initial request, to the final response itself.
        </p>
        <p>
          Flask Application was hosted on a Heroku instance running Python, and initially posed some issues because we were not able
          to use any known Linked Data databases, and storing data directly into files was out of the question. After a bit of research, 
          we found out that it is possible to host Fuseki, which is the WebApp running Jena, on the cloud. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Heroku being our selected Cloud Services Provider we raised another instance running Java, and with some small changes we managed to 
          establish a link between API and LinkedData storage. This greatly increased our ability to interact with the storage, due to the fact
          that it was shared accross development and production environments.

          It is a framework which extends the python application to a capable Web API. With the built-in modules, Flask is very potent
          ranging from the ability of declaring controllers and structure them using Blueprint, to even a module consisting of handling.

          The screens hierarchy has been structured with the focus on the group entity, as that's where the user will

            that needs to be shared by the creator of the group.
          </p>
          <p>
            This screen has no other purpose than presenting the user with the group that he's about to join, and
            checking if they're logged in or not, in which case an input asking for the user's name will be shown, so
            the user can join the group as a temporary member.

            The registration screen is very similar with the login screen, both in user experience and purpose. If the
            user has no registered account, they can chose to create an account, via the registration form.
          </p>

          <p>
            This screen has a link back to the login screen, in case the user got here by mistake, and they already have
            an account.
          </p>
          <p>
            Both the registration and the login screen will redirect the user to the main screen after the
            authentication is successful.

          <h4>Main Screen (Groups list screen)</h4>
          <p>
            The main screen of the application presents the user with all the groups that they are a member of. The
            groups are presented in a mobile-friendly manner, using <strong>cards</strong>, and large control buttons.
          </p>

            </a>
          </figure>
          <p>Each group card may have two options: group settings, and group devices.</p>
          <ul>

              <strong>Group settings</strong> button will redirect the user to the group settings, which we will discuss
              later. This option is available only for the creator of the group.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Group devices</strong> button will redirect the user to the devices screen, which we will also
              discuss later. This option is available for each member of the group.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            It is worth noting that there is a button that allows the user to create a new group. This button will show
            a modal that requires the user to input the group name, and will create a new group with that name. This
            option is available just for the registered accounts, so temporary group members will not be able to create
            groups

            associated devices.

          <p>
            Furthermore, the owner of the group can see a list of all the group members, including himself, and they can
            also remove any member of the group.
