        <h3>UI Motivation</h3>
        <p>
          This application is mainly focused on mobile devices, therefore we need a simple layout, that the user can
          easily interact with in a tactile manner.
        </p>
        <p>
          The screens hierarchy has been structured with the focus on the group entity, as that's where the user will
          spend most of its time. The following figure illustrates the screens hierarchy.
        </p>
        <figure typeof="sa:image">
          <a href="diagrams/ui-routing.jpg" target="_blank">
            <img src="diagrams/ui-routing.jpg" alt="user interface routing" />
          </a>
        </figure>
        <p>
          In the next sections we will discuss each screen with respect to its functionality, layout and UI/UX
          considerations.
        </p>

        <h3>UI Screens</h3>
        <section id="splash-screen">
          <h3>Splash Screen</h3>
          <p>
            Although the splash screen is not really visible, it is present, and it's purpuse it's to decide the further
            direction that the user should take in our application.
          </p>
          <p>
            It primarily tries to redirect to the user groups screen, and if that fails due to the user not being
            authenticated, it will redirect the user to the authentication module.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section id="group-join-screen">
          <h4>Group Joining Screen</h4>
          <p>
            In the context of WET application, users can adhere to other groups by accessing a special joining address,
            that needs to be shared by the creator of the group.
          </p>
          <p>
            This screen has no other purpose than presenting the user with the group that he's about to join, and
            checking if they're logged in or not, in which case an input asking for the user's name will be shown, so
            the user can join the group as a temporary member.
          </p>
          <figure typeof="sa:image">
            <a href="assets/screenshots/join-group.jpg" target="_blank">
              <img src="assets/screenshots/join-group.jpg" alt="join group" />
            </a>
          </figure>
          <p>
            After confirming the group join, the user will be (authenticated if they're a temporary group member and)
            redirected to the main screen of the application, which is the group list, that we will discuss later.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section id="login-screen">
          <h4>Login Screen</h4>
          <p>
            In the case that the user is not authenticated, and he is not accessing a group join link, the login screen
            is the first interaction with the application
          </p>
          <p>
            The purpose of this screen is clear, we need to authenticate already registered users via username and
            password.
          </p>
          <figure typeof="sa:image">
            <a href="assets/screenshots/login-screen.jpg" target="_blank">

            </a>
          </figure>
          <p>
            The user is presented with a minimal form, with 2 fields: <strong>username</strong> and
            <strong>password</strong>. There is also a button to redirect to the registration screen, in case the user
            is not already registered.
          </p>
          <p>
            These fields have a validation that ensures the fields are not empty, and disables the submit button
            otherwise.
          </p>
          <figure typeof="sa:image">

        <section id="register-screen">
          <h4>Register Screen</h4>
          <p>
            The registration screen is very similar with the login screen, both in user experience and purpose. If the
            user has no registered account, they can chose to create an account, via the registration form.
          </p>
          <figure typeof="sa:image">

            </a>
          </figure>
          <p>
            This screen has a link back to the login screen, in case the user got here by mistake, and they already have
            an account.
          </p>
          <p>
            Both the registration and the login screen will redirect the user to the main screen after the
            authentication is successful.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section id="main-screen">
          <h4>Main Screen (Groups list screen)</h4>
          <p>
            The main screen of the application presents the user with all the groups that they are a member of. The
            groups are presented in a mobile-friendly manner, using <strong>cards</strong>, and large control buttons.
          </p>
          <figure typeof="sa:image">
            <a href="assets/screenshots/groups-list.jpg" target="_blank">
              <img src="assets/screenshots/groups-list.jpg" alt="login" />
            </a>
          </figure>
          <p>Each group card may have two options: group settings, and group devices.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Group settings</strong> button will redirect the user to the group settings, which we will discuss
              later. This option is available only for the creator of the group.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Group devices</strong> button will redirect the user to the devices screen, which we will also
              discuss later. This option is available for each member of the group.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            It is worth noting that there is a button that allows the user to create a new group. This button will show
            a modal that requires the user to input the group name, and will create a new group with that name. This
            option is available just for the registered accounts, so temporary group members will not be able to create
            groups
          </p>
          <figure typeof="sa:image">

          </figure>
          <p>
            First, the owner has the option to invite other members to their group by sharing a group join link, and the
            process is described in <a href="#group-join-screen">this</a> section.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then the user has the ability to delete their group, which will delete any temporary users as well as its
            associated devices.
          </p>
          <p>
            Furthermore, the owner of the group can see a list of all the group members, including himself, and they can
            also remove any member of the group.

          <h4>Group Devices</h4>
          <p>
            Each group member can see the list of devices associated with the group. These devices are presented using
            <strong>cards</strong> along with minimal information including a <strong>nickname</strong>,
            <strong>device name</strong>, <strong>device type</strong>.
          </p>

            These discovered devices are displayed in a list, with information about the device's name, type and an easy
